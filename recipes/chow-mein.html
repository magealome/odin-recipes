          <h3>Cooking</h3>  
             <ol>
                <li>Boil the noodles using the instructions on the package</li>
                <li>Wash the noodles in cold water and put them on a plate with some oil, making sure that they are seperated to some degree</li>
                <li>Whisk the eggs together in a bowl and add some chicken powder and white pepper</li>
                <li>Chop the onion and carrots, chop the garlic. Add it to a bowl (you will soon find out why all the bowls are crucial)</li>
                <li>Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces</li>
                <li>Fire up your wok, add a good amount of oil and fry a very soft omelette with your eggs, and then pour them back to the old bowl</li>
                <li>Bring the wok back to a high temperature, add some oil, and add your vegetables until they get a golden brown colour. 
                    And then pour them back to their bowl</li>
                <li>Do the same with the chicken, but make sure to season it and NOT to add it to the old bowl, but bring out a new one instead</li>
                <li>And now for the noodles. Add the soy sauce and season to your liking and whisk together with all the other ingredients. </li>
             </ol>
                    <b>Pro tip: To get an even amount of sauce on your dish, pour the sauce in on the side of the wok and then toss together.</b>
